# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Convolution over RGB images (3d)

## Building a CNN

![A single layer](/Notes/7.%20CNN/a%20single%20layer%20of%20cnn.png)

CNNs are less prone to over fitting

Types of layer in CNN:

 1. Convolution
 2. Pooling
 3. Fully connected


## Pooling

### Max pooling

![Max pooling](/Notes/7.%20CNN/max%20pooling.png)

It takes a certain area and only keeps the highest value in the area.

It helps make the image smaller and keep only important features and discards less imp features.

For multiple channels, max pooling is done individually on each channel.

### Average pooling

Not used often, just finds average of a certain area.

## Why convolutions?

Convolutions help us make the image smaller so we are not passing huge amounts of data to our neural network.
It also decreases the maount of parameters.
