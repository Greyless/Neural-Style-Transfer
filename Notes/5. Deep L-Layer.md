# Deep L-Layer Neural Network

A netwrok with multiple layers is **deep** while a networ with less layers is called **shallow**

## Forward Propagation

![Forward Propagation](/Notes/5.%20Deep%20L-Layer/forward%20propagation.png)

When dealing with such large , matrices, get your dimensions right.

## Intuition about Deep Layer Learning

![Intuition](/Notes/5.%20Deep%20L-Layer/Intuition.png)

The early layers detect more basic features and the later layers pick up more complex features.
