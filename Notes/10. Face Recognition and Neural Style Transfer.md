# Face Recognition

For face recognition, we genrally have only one face for each person to compare to and we dont have a large database for each person, therefor we need a fucntion **d** that gives us the degree of difference between the data image and the input image. For this, we use Siamese NEtwork

## Siamese Network

We will use a ConvNet and obtain a vector in the end that is not passed through softmax since we are no classifying.

This vector will be compared when we want to conmpare 2 images. The function d is given as follows:

![Siamese Network](/Notes/10.%20Face%20Recognition%20and%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer/siamese%20network.png)

We will use backprop to obtain parameters that satisy the goven conditions.

![Learning Objectives](/Notes/10.%20Face%20Recognition%20and%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer/LEarning%20Objectives%20face%20recog.png)

We want the d(A,P) to be smaller than d(A,N). To further intensifying the divide, we add alpha to d(A,N) which ensures that the difference is atleast equal to alpha.

Triple function is defines using 3 images - anchor, positive example and negatove example.

We can have multiple sets for the same person while training.
To train we need to choose triplets that are "hard" to train on. If chosen randomly, d(A,P) will almost always be smaller than d(A,N).

Another way to train the neural network is as follows:

Take 2 identical neural netoworks and pass the images to be compared to each of them individually. Take the 128 lnong vectors from both neural networks and use this 256 long vector to apply sigmoid to it. The sigmoid will be closer to 1 if the faces match and closer to 0 if they dont.

The activationn applied is as follows:

# Neural Style Transfer

We know that earlier stages of a CNN pick up more basic features like lines and the later layers of the CNN pick up more complex features like tires, eyes, legs, etc.

Neural style transfer requires a style image and a content image.

## Cost Function

![NST cost function](/Notes/10.%20Face%20Recognition%20and%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer/NST%20cost%20function.png)

We start with a completely random image and slowly, using gradient descent, take the image closer and closer to both the content image and the style image while reduing the loss.

![NST process](/Notes/10.%20Face%20Recognition%20and%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer/NST%20process.png)

The features for both style and content are picked up from different layers becaue different layers detect different levels of complexity.

If the features of content were detected from say layer 'l', the cost function wrt to the generated image will be calculate using layer 'l' of both the content image and the generated image.

![Content Cost funcition](/Notes/10.%20Face%20Recognition%20and%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer/NST%20content%20cost%20function.png)

When we consider style, a style usually is defined by the relation of one feature of the style to the other.

To capture this, we need to consider 2 channels in a layer of CNN. Each channel detects different features and if for the features of these 2 channels, if they occur together, they are correlated. So, we need to find what features are correlated and which ones aren't.

To compare the Generated image and the Style image, we need to compare the same 2 channels in both images to see if the correlation between the 2 channels is the same.

![NST style matrix](/Notes/10.%20Face%20Recognition%20and%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer/NST%20style%20matrix.png)

Fr cost function, the authors used a Normalization constant.

![Style cost function](/Notes/10.%20Face%20Recognition%20and%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer/style%20cost%20function.png)

We get more pleasing results if we use different layers, so the cost function becomes:
