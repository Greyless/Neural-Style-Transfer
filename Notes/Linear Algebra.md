#Linea Algebra

**Vector**
Physics Perspective - _Arrow with Direction and Length_
CS Perspective - _List of Numbers_
Maths Perspective - _Anything with a sensible notion_

The numbers that define a vector give the location of the head of the arrow x,y,z

Addition of vectors gives a vector that gives the same final postion as the two vectors performed one after the other.

Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes the magnitude.

Vectors have geometrical and mathematical reresentation which are interchangeable.

**Basis Vectors**

These vectors when multiplied by scalars and added can give the location of all the vectors in space.

We use _i^_ (x-axis) , _j^(y-axis)_ and _k^(z-axis)_ as our bbases vectors

The _"span"_ of given vectors is the set of all their linear combinations, i.e all the vectors that can be representated by the given vectors
For 2 non co-linear vectors, the span is the entire 2d-space while for co-linear vectors the span is a line.

When we have a few vectors and we can remove one of them without changing the span, we call them **linearly dependent**. For eg, 2 co-linear vectors or 3 co-planar vectors.

When all the vectors are important for the span, the vectors are called **linearly independent**.
