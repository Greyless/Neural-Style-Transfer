# Vectorization

We know that we need to find the weighted sum for a list of data. If we do it in normal way, we will need a for loop to loop through all the weights and the values and then we need to multiply and add them.

But, if we vectorize our data (matrices), we can do the multiplication much faster in python (numpy).

We can understand that the weigth matrix needs to be transposed for multiplication.

For vectorized multiplication, the numpy method is as follows

The difference in time taken by both methods can be of factor 500, which gives huge savings in time.
